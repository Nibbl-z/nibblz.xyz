        `Kaboom Kompetition is my current flagship project, a competitive destruction/PVP game with rocket launchers and timebombs. Earn points through the destruction and through killing other players; the player with the most points at the end wins!

        You earn Tokens and XP based on your performance during the rounds, which can be exchanged for weapon skins and emotes, as well as many abilities that can enhance your gameplay.

        There are 11 different gamemodes, 7 different modifiers, and 7 maps, resulting in a total of 539 different combinations!`,
